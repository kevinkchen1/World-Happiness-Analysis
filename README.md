# World Happiness Analysis
For this project, I investigated open source data on 2021 World Happiness across all countries. While analyzing the data, I determined four factors that have significant impact on a country's happiness: GDP Per Capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, and Freedom to make life choices

I examined the relationship between each of the factors in the dataset and the country's happiness score. The results I found were that a country's GDP per capita had the significant impact on its overall happiness, having the highest correlation in the scatterplot.

I also analyzed the relationships between the other factors and the country's happiness score through a wide variety of visualization formats, with a stronger correlation indicating that the factor has more of an effect on the happiness score. My visualizations included scatterplots, bar charts, cat and whisker plots.
